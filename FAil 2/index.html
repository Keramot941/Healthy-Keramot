            <p>
                Hello! I'm Shibli Mahmmud. I'm a CSE Engineer. And I'm Web designer. And I am learning MERN Full Stack web development. And I practice most of the day. And I practice most of the day. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.

                    Guacamole Salad
                </h3>
                <p>Our Guacamole Salad is a bright, crunchy, and vegetal take on everyone's favorite avocado-based dip. The fresh vegetables provide crunch that contrasts the creamy avocado, while the coriander vinaigrette is subtly acidic and doesn't overshadow the rest of the ingredients.</p>

                <h3>Pasta Salad</h3>
                <p>We combined two potluck classics—pasta salad and three-bean salad—to make one tasty new side dish. Blanched celery is the unexpected star in this side dish; it has a tender-crisp texture and bright green color.</p>
